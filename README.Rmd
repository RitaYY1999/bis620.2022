## Description

bis620.2022 contains the R functions, test files and test coverage used for analyze [`ukb_accel`](https://github.com/RitaYY1999/bis620.2022/tree/main/data) data in BIS620 (FALL 2022) course at Yale University. After installing and loading the package, users will be able to reproduce the same results from their local computers using the corresponding R command and data set.

## Getting Started

You can install the development version of bis620.2022 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RitaYY1999/bis620.2022")
```

You can use the package by:

```r
install.packages("bis620.2022")
library(bis620.2022)
```

## Usage

* To write "hello,yy" to the console, you can use `hello()` function:

```r
hello("yy")
```

* To plot UKBiobank Accelerometry Data, you can use `accel_plot()` function:

```r
data(ukb_accel)
accel_plot(ukb_accel[1:1000,])
```
`accel_plot()` can plot not only data with "time" column but also with "freq" column For example, you can plot frequency data by:

```r
data(ukb_accel)
accel_plot(spectral_signature(ukb_accel[1:1000,]))
```
* To get the Spectral Signature of Accelerometry Data, you can use `spectral_signature()` function:

```r
spectral_signature(ukb_accel[1:1000,])
# The spectral signature is calculated by taking the modulus of the fourier coefficients of the signal.
```
